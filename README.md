## Description

I uploaded the dataset and explored basic information, checked structure and statistics. I have filtered the data to separate records by gender (female and male). Then I created bar charts to visualize the number of passengers per satisfaction category. Pie charts show the percentage distribution of satisfaction between women and men. I used bar plot to compare the satisfaction of both groups. Finally I performed chi-square test to check if the difference between genders is statistically significant

**Python Skills:**
- Loading datasets
- cleaning data and using basic statistical checks
- Filtering and grouping data  
- Creating charts   
- Performing chi-square test

## Results
More than half of both female and male passengers are neutral or dissatisfied. The difference between female and male passengers is small. The chi-square test confirms that the difference is not statistically significant
